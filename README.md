# Text-Detection
This code captures images from the computer camera, displays the captured image on the screen, and saves the image to a file named "secondTest.png" when the user presses the 's' key. Subsequently, it utilizes the Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library to extract text from the saved image and prints it on the screen.
